Adds ModLoader hooks for IL editing and On detouring

To use these hooks, download the mod, extract it and copy the lib folder into your mod.

Once you've done that, paste the following into your csproj file:


<ItemGroup>
  <Reference Include="ModLoaderHooks">
    <HintPath>lib\ModLoaderHooks.dll</HintPath>
  </Reference>
</ItemGroup>


After that, add the following to your build.txt file:


modReferences = ModLoaderHooksMod
